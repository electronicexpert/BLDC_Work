My first trial was on breadboard, but this did not went well, some MOSFET-Drivers died
and in the end there was a nasty hole in my bredboard. But the motor runs 2 or 3 times ..

Second trial was the nice, handwrapped PCP (consists of 2 boards). This is functional!

Third board is my status quo.

Before I began to investigate myself, I bought 2 Controller-Boards by AMAZON, one with Hall, the other
for BEMF. The difference between those boards is the analog comparator and some RC-stuff.
