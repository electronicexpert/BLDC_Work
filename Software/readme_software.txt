The software was created with STM32CubeIDE 1.15.1

I used 2 STM32 Chips: a STM32F429ZIT6 on my Discovery Board.
                      a STM32G070KBT6 on my Motorcontroller.

I flashed the Motorcontroller with help of the Discovery Board.


Unfortunately I can't post all the project files, because limitation of this server.

Thanks to Gil Vargas (BLDC-Part), Majid Derhambakksh (PID-Part) and Kristian Lauszus (KALMAN-Part)
